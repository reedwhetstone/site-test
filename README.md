# site-test

Given the limited time I was unable to begin working on responsive aspects of the page
such as mobile.

I considered using bootstrap for fast responsive layout and access to features such as
the proposed large image window but opted to have the page look exactly as proposed.
The request was specifically for HTML and CSS and bootstrap would have implemented .js
for the large window implementation anyway.

Thank you for your time,
Reed
